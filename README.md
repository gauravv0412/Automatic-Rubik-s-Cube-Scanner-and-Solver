# Automatic-Rubik-s-Cube-Scanner-and-Solver

This Project scans the user's rubiks cube, and after analysing the scanned cube for the current configuration, generates a solution for the cube to solve it in minimum steps. 

The project uses Kociemba Algorithm to find solution of the cube.

This project also uniquely generated the simulation video to guide the user how to apply the steps to solve to the cube.

Command to run the project :-
```python script.py```
