# Automatic-Rubik-s-Cube-Scanner-and-Solver

This Project scans the user's rubiks cube, and after analysing the scanned cube for the current configuration, generates a solution for the cube to solve it in minimum steps. 

The project uses Kociemba Algorithm to find solution of the scanned cube.

This project also uniquely generates the simulation video to guide the user on how to apply the steps to solve the cube.

Command to run the project :-
```python script.py```
